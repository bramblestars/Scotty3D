MeshEdit checkpoint writeup

EdgeSplit: fully implemented
 - splits an edge only when adjacent faces are triangles (except outer face)
 - splits boundary edges properly

EdgeFlip: fully implemented
 - does nothing when selected edge is incident to a single face (resulting from EraseEdge)
   ex. 
         /\
        /_ \
        \  /
         \/
          
 - behavior might be strange if one of the selected edge's degree is 2 (resulting from EraseEdge),
   but not unexpected

EdgeCollapse: fully implemented
 - does nothing when selected edge is incident to a single face

FaceBevel: fully implemented
 - I wasn't able to call the face's centroid and normal without issue, so I calculated them myself
   using the original vertex positions and using two edges' cross products, respectively, in calculating the new
   vertex positions.

EraseEdge: fully implemented
 - does nothing when selected edge is incident to a single face, and both of its degrees is 2. 
 - however, does handle cases where there exists a vertex of degree 1, and allows you to delete such edges
 - if there is a path sticking out into a face with all edges incident to that single face, must delete edges starting from the end of the path.
